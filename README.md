## Description 
```
I built a react portfolio: a place to show my projects so that I can share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

```
## User Story 
```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
